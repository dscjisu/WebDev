The first day of the web development bootcamp was spent teaching us the foundational concepts and tenets of the internet.
The following are the subjects that I learned about throughout this session.

A domain name is a generic name given to a website that stores the website's location and points to its IP address.

DNS
Domain Name System, or DNS, converts domain names into IP addresses. Since internet resources only communicate via IP addresses, so that the web browser can load internet resources using IP addresses. Every internet-connected device has a different IP address from other devices. With the help of this distinctive IP address, DNS enables the device to be located.

The internet's phone book is DNS. Each device has a hardcoded IP address called a DNS resolver that receives requests from client browsers looking for certain IP addresses. When a browser requests a DNS, it communicates with other DNS Servers who might know where the required Ip address of the webpage is stored since it functions on the principle of "I don't know, but I know someone who might know."

HTTP/HTTPS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol is known as HTTP. To establish a successful communication, the client and server must adhere to a set of rules. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secured is referred to as HTTPS. Data that has been encrypted is transferred using it. Since HTTP lacks security, we cannot transfer encrypted data there.

Status Number
A server's message to a requested resource is communicated through the status code. Example: A 404 error code means the requested resource was not found, but a 200 result means everything went OK.

Port names and numbers
Different services on the same server and PC are identified by their respective port numbers. Ports are the doorways that allow information to enter and exit a computer, if we think of it as a house. Additionally, port numbers have a limit.

Request Techniques
There are several request methods available in HTTP that detail the action that is being asked of the server.

The GET command retrieves and displays data from a web server. Data can be sent to a server using a POST request. PUT: PUT is used to add new resources to a server or to edit material already present on the server. PATCH: PUT's opposite in that it only alters a specific area of the server. DELETE: This command is used to remove specific data from a server location.
