The topic is about the web-dev bootcamp session 1 ( Internet fundamentals as well as IOT )

As it is the beggining of the web development boot camp, we must know the basic concepts of some networking fundamentals before starting about web development.

First thing our beloved sir abhishek khuswaha asked what is the INTERNET? 
1. internet and DOMAIN
2. ISP and IP Address
3. DNS and server
4. HTTP and HTTPS
5. HTTP REQUEST , PORT and how a website work 

Many of us told that (it is a global computer network which provides a variety of information and communication facilities..and also it is consisting of interconnected 

networks using standarized protocols).

next i learn about the DOMAIN. Domain is the one of the important thing of the internet.

next how the domain works...etc. Here into the domain, we learn about IP ADDRESS and relation between domain and ip with some examples. also tracing out the location 
via IP address (the importance), and how to check id from ccommand promt in windows.

after IP , we learn ISP( internet service provider) and DNS (domain name system) and servers.

 Eg.the DNS like a share broker who gathers information from the others source (means share information) from internet withing milisecond. also about the dns resolver.
 
 http(hyper text transfer protocol) and https(hyper text transfer protocol secure) , main difference is https has encryption key...for google chrome, encryption keys are provided by
 google...it varries in every server. 
 
 http reequest is made out of three components...request line, headers and message body. also the most commonly http requests ( GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE )
 and the meaning of error 201, error 404, 503, 403, 301, 401 etc. what the following numbers denotes about the http server/website whats wrong on it.
 
 what isthe protocols, and the ports...port is like a gate to open a server/website...and the website/server shows in form  of external IP address , also the relation 
 between ports and IP address.
 
 some examples of projects for showing how a server work by our sir abhishek khuswaha's project.
