## Things I learned TODAY

Today we have learned about Fundamentals Of Internet.Firstly,we get know what is INTERNET and what is NETWORK then our mentor(Abhishek bhaiya) told us the agenda of
today's class.
The main agenda of today's class was:-
1. How domain works,
2. How DNS resolver works,
3. What is HTTPS request.
Abhishek bhaiya started the class by telling us about DNS(Domain Name System) in which we get to know about IP address and PORTS and also about ISP,Computer Networks and
DNS Server ,also we get to know about difference between INTERNAL IP address and EXTERNAL IP address.Then we get to know about DNS Resolver firstly many of them can't 
understood what bhaiya told but after the two example that bhaiya told us all get clear understanding about DNS Resolver , when bhaiya gave the 1st example I feel happy 
as I was the DNS Resolver in his example who help his friend to get the address of the friend which he wants, in between one of our senior cracked a joke about 
DNS REsolver which bhaiya repeated and we all laughed at that joke.Then we get to know about HTTP and HTTPS what are they and what the difference between them.Then we get
to know what is HTTPS request method and we use this method  ,in this section we get to know about some new terms : GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and POST,bhaiya told all
things about this terms their definitions , how these use and also bhaiya told us about some HTTP status code like 404 for NOT FOUND , 200 for OK etc. Then bhaiya show us
the demo of the topic which he covered till now through the site which he build. In the demo he also shows us how we can check IP from CMD.Then atlast he gave us the 
assignment and shows us how to put it on  GITHUB ,then he asked all of us to come up with the doubt which they have and soved their doubts.This all happen in today's 
class through which many of us got to know about the Fundamentals of Internet and get to know something new and interesting topic about Internet which I think I not able
to get somewhere else.Lastly I would like to thanks GDSC for organising this WEB DEVELOPMENT Bootcamp.
