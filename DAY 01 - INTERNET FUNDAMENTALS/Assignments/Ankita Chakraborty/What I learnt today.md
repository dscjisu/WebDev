Extra---A demo⭐
ISP-Internet Service Provider is an organization which provides access to internet.
DNS-To prevent hackers from hacking an organization's website a "Domain Name" is assigned to the websites.
DNS Resolver-It is a service which connects a request and the required website which is being requested for by the user. It acts like a phone book by keeping track of the sites visited by us.
HTTP and HTTPS-These are the internet protocols which sends our requests in such a format that it can't be accessed by third parties and HTTPS sends our requests in an encrypted format thereby providing extra security.
Ports-Ports are like gateways and each device and websites has unique port
HTTP methods-There are HTTP methods such as-PUT,POST,GET,PATCH,DELETE.PUT,POST AND GET methods were primarily discussed during this session as they are the main three methods which are widely used.
During this session we also got to know how can we know the port and IP addresses of our machine using cmd.
Finally during the demo our speaker tried to demonstrate the above ideas using our GDSC JISU website.
