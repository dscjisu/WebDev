firstly, I learnt how domain works?

When you enter a domain name in your web browser, it first sends a request to a global network of servers that form the
Domain Name System (DNS).
for example.when we enter youtube.com,it first sends a request to a Domain name system(DNS).These name servers are computers managed by your hosting company. 
 hosting provider will forward your request to the computer where your website is stored.
 The web server now fetches the web page and pieces of information associated with it.
Finally, it then sends this data back to the userâ€™s browser.

then,i learnt what is DNS?
A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human readable names like www.example.com into the numeric 
IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.

atlast i learnt,what is HTTP request and what are the methods of HTTP request?
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

GET
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URL.
POST
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc.
PUT
Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.
DELETE
Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URL.
